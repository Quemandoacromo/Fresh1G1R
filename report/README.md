# Retool Processing Reports

This directory contains detailed processing reports generated by [Retool](https://github.com/unexpectedpanda/retool) for each DAT file that has been processed.

## What's Here?

These are **Retool-generated reports** that show:
- ✅ What ROMs/games were **kept** (included in the final 1G1R DAT)
- ❌ What ROMs/games were **removed** (filtered out)
- 📊 Detailed statistics about the filtering process
- 🔍 Information about duplicates, regions, languages, and other filtering criteria

## Directory Structure

```

├── Hearto/
│   ├── redump/     # Reports for processed Redump DATs

## Report File Names

Reports retain their original Retool-generated filenames, which include:
- System name
- Original DAT date
- Retool version and timestamp
- Retool flags used

Example: `Sony - PlayStation (2025-10-23 18-11-28) (Retool 2026-01-10 12-39-40) (-l) [-aAbBcdDefkmMopPruv] report.txt`

## Report Retention

- The **last 7 reports** per system are kept automatically
- Older reports are cleaned up to save space
- This ensures you can review recent processing history without accumulating too many files

## How to Use Reports

1. **Review Filtering**: See exactly what was kept/removed for each system
2. **Troubleshooting**: Understand why certain ROMs were filtered out
3. **Verification**: Verify that the filtering rules are working as expected
4. **Statistics**: Check processing statistics and counts

## Understanding Report Format

Reports use a simple format:
- `+` prefix = ROM/game was **kept** (included)
- `-` prefix = ROM/game was **removed** (filtered out)
- Indentation shows relationships (e.g., which version was kept vs. removed)
